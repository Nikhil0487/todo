# App for tracking my everyday To Dos

Tasks tracker app for tracking everyday tasks and their results. 

Work in progress

I am noting down the ideas at https://github.com/Nikhil0487/todo/projects/3

Fundamental design is as follows

1. Pick a date after signing with Google

2. Add/update/remove tasks for each date

Yet to implement

I have some ideas like

1. Showing weekly/monthly graphs based on a variety of factors like: 

a. Task type wise 

b. Task status wise like completed/inprogress/yet-to tasks

c. Get some interesting but useful things with data using AI?
